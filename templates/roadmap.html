        <div class="intro">
            <p>Everything that happens to you is your responsibility. Not because life is fair—it isn't—but because you are the only variable you control. Your circumstances, your relationships, your failures, your wins: all of it sits in your hands whether you like it or not. This is not a burden. It is the only path to power. The moment you accept complete ownership is the moment you can actually change something.</p>
            <p>The Laws of Ascension is built on six principles that separate those who drift from those who direct. They are operating rules for anyone serious about closing the gap between where they are and what they want. Study them below. Internalize them. Then get to work.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Reality Over Fantasy</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">The world responds to what you are, not what you believe you deserve. Comfortable lies feel good and cost everything. See yourself and your situation with ruthless clarity - diagnosis must come before treatment. Truth is the only foundation that holds weight.</p>
                </div>

                    </div>
                    <h3 class="card-title">Awareness Over Drift</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">Most people sleepwalk through decades, reacting to life instead of directing it. You cannot change what you do not notice. Watch your patterns, your impulses, your actual choices - not the story you tell yourself about them. Wake up to your own life before it's over.</p>
                </div>

                    </div>
                    <h3 class="card-title">Ownership Over Blame</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">Everything in your life is your responsibility. Not your fault, perhaps, but your problem to solve. External explanations might be accurate and still completely useless. Victims are right and powerless. The only question to be asked is "what now?"</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Execution Over Aspiration</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">Plans, intentions, and goals are worthless without action. The gap between knowing and doing is where lives go to die. Build systems, not wishes. Fall in love with the process or find a different process. Results are the only metric that doesn't lie to you.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Discomfort Over Comfort</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">Growth lives on the other side of what you'd rather avoid. Comfort is a slow death dressed as safety. The hard conversation, the early morning, the rejection, the failure - these are the price of admission. Pay it willingly or stay where you are.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Patience Over Urgency</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">Compounding works for skills, relationships, and wealth - but only across time. Impatience makes you choose fast over right. Play long games with long-term people. The desperate move is almost always the wrong move.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Baselines</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Ambition without foundation is delusion. You cannot build a career, a relationship, or a legacy on a crumbling base. Before you chase anything advanced, these three baselines must be locked in. Skip them and you'll spend years chasing goals you're not equipped to hold—wondering why success keeps slipping through your fingers. Master these first. Everything else gets easier once you do.</p>
