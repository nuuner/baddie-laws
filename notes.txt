Things that need to be solved first before you start anything:

- Appearance baseline
- Health baseline
- Connection baseline

Concepts:

- Reality over fantasy
  - The world responds to what you are, not what you believe you deserve. Comfortable lies feel good and cost everything. See yourself and your situation with ruthless clarity - diagnosis must come before treatment. Truth is the only foundation that holds weight.
- Awareness over drift
  - Most people sleepwalk through decades, reacting to life instead of directing it. You cannot change what you do not notice. Watch your patterns, your impulses, your actual choices - not the story you tell yourself about them. Wake up to your own life before it's over.
- Ownership over blame
  - Everything in your life is your responsibility. Not your fault, perhaps, but your problem to solve. External explanations might be accurate and still completely useless. Victims are right and powerless. The only question worth asking is "what now?"
- Execution over aspiration
  - Plans, intentions, and goals are worthless without action. The gap between knowing and doing is where lives go to die. Build systems, not wishes. Fall in love with the process or find a different process. Results are the only metric that doesn't lie to you.
- Discomfort over comfort
  - Growth lives on the other side of what you'd rather avoid. Comfort is a slow death dressed as safety. The hard conversation, the early morning, the rejection, the failure - these are the price of admission. Pay it willingly or stay where you are.
- Patience over urgency
  - Compounding works for skills, relationships, and wealth - but only across time. Impatience makes you choose fast over right. Play long games with long-term people. The desperate move is almost always the wrong move.

Problems people want solved:

- How do I attract the romantic partner I want?
- How do I get more money?
- How do I build a social circle?
- How do I get in shape and stay healthy?
- How do I find work that is both fulfilling and well-paying?
- How do I stop feeling constantly stressed and overwhelmed?
- How do I find time for things I want to do?
- How do I control my reputation?
- How do I figure out what I actually want to do with my life?
